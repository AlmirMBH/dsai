/**
Write a C++ program that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number without using recursion.
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- For n â‰¥ 2 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
The program should:
- Accept an "integer n" as input from the user.
- Calculate and print the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach (not recursion).
- Also, program should print all Fibonacci numbers which are smaller than n-th Fibonacci number.
