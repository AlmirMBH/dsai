PatternScope AI – Hybrid Pattern Recognition System

Rijalda Šaćirbegović, Almir Mustafić, Tarik Bajrović

Summary:
PatternScope AI is a desktop application built in C++ with a natID graphical interface. It performs hybrid pattern recognition using supervised machine learning models, heuristic A* template matching and a lightweight rule-based reasoning layer. The application recognizes MNIST-style digits, geometric
shapes and custom user-drawn symbols. User-drawn symbols are restricted to the predefined classes (digits, shapes and simple symbolic marks). Users can load images, draw symbols on the canvas, classify them and analyze the results in real time while comparing multiple AI approaches.

Application Overview
The system begins with a mode-selection screen where the user chooses between:
Digit recognition (MNIST-compatible)
Geometric Shape Recognition
Custom Symbol Recognition

The main interface includes:
Interactive drawing and image canvas
Prediction panel with confidence scores
Model comparison panel (KNN, Naive Bayes, Mini-MLP)
A* and Rule-based reasoning panel
Tools for loading images, drawing symbols, training and viewing confusion matrices

Core AI Components
1. Multi-Model Classification Engine
Three supervised models implemented in C++:
KNN – baseline classifier using distance in feature space
Naive Bayes – probabilistic classifier suitable for grayscale patterns
Mini-MLP – small neural network with one hidden layer for nonlinear decision boundaries

2. Feature Extraction Module
Includes multiple descriptor types:
Down sampled raw pixel grid
SIFT edge map
Simplified HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)

3. Active-Learning Agent

- Detects low-confidence predictions
- Requests user confirmation
- Updates dataset incrementally (primarily benefiting KNN)

4. Heuristic Search Component (A*)
  A* is used for template matching in a compact feature space:
Templates represented as feature vectors
Heuristic = feature vector distance
Produces explainable, deterministic decisions

5. Rule-Based Reasoning Layer
A small interpretable rule system:
Uses edge count, corner detection and structural properties
Provides fallback decisions when ML confidence is low

6. natID GUI
- Mode-selection screen
- Main recognition workspace
- Real-time prediction and model visualization
