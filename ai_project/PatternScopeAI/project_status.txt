================================================================================
IN PROGRESS / PARTIAL
================================================================================

PHASE 9: MINIMAL natID GUI (REMAINING)
- Mode selection screen (digits/shapes/symbols) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Image file loading - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Real-time prediction updates (currently requires button click)
- Confusion matrix view - NOT IMPLEMENTED

================================================================================
NOT IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

Shape Recognition Mode
- Geometric shape dataset
- Shape-specific feature extractors
- Shape classification models

Custom Symbol Recognition Mode
- Symbol dataset
- Symbol-specific templates
- Symbol classification

GUI Features
- Mode selection screen
- Image file loading dialog
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Real-time prediction updates (as user draws)
- Model comparison visualization

================================================================================
CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY
================================================================================

Console Version:
- Loads MNIST dataset
- Trains all models (KNN, NaiveBayes, MiniMLP)
- Tests models on test set
- Demonstrates A* template matching
- Tests rule-based reasoning
- Shows accuracy metrics

GUI Version (Digits Mode Only):
- Models train automatically on startup
- User can draw digits on 28x28 canvas
- Mouse drawing (click and drag)
- Clear button resets canvas
- Predict button runs all models
- Displays predictions with confidence scores:
    * KNN prediction and confidence
    * NaiveBayes prediction and confidence
    * MiniMLP prediction and confidence
    * A* prediction and confidence
    * Rule-based prediction and confidence
- Active learning: detects low confidence and prompts for user feedback
- Incremental model updates with user-provided labels

================================================================================
ISSUES
================================================================================

1. GUI Prediction Display:
   - Uses Button::setText() which does not work properly
   - If compilation fails, need alternative display method

2. Model Training:
   - Currently uses 1000 samples for faster training
   - Full dataset training would improve accuracy

3. A* Templates:
   - Uses 100 templates from test set
   - Could be expanded for better coverage

4. Real-time Updates:
   - Predictions require button click
   - No automatic updates as user draws

5. Mode Selection:
   - Only digits mode implemented
   - Shapes and symbols modes not implemented

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS (PRIORITY ORDER)
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1 (Required for Basic Submission):
1. Fix GUI prediction display if Button::setText() doesn't exist
   - Alternative: Draw predictions on canvas or use different component
2. Test GUI build and ensure it compiles
3. Verify GUI runs on target platforms

PRIORITY 2 (Enhancement):
4. Add mode selection screen (digits/shapes/symbols)
5. Implement image file loading
6. Add real-time prediction updates (update as user draws)

PRIORITY 3 (Optional):
7. Add confusion matrix view
8. Implement shape recognition mode
9. Implement custom symbol recognition mode
