# Examples of datasets
# Medical data: Patient records, medical images (e.g. X-ray images are used for classifying diseases).#
# Retail data: Product sales, customer data (e.g. customer purchase histories are used to recommend products).
# Financial data: Stock prices, transactions (e.g. predicting stock prices based on historical data).

# Some key aspects of good data are:
# Accuracy: Free from errors.
# Completeness: No missing data or incomplete records.
# Consistency: Uniform formatting across the dataset.
# Relevance: Contains features that matter for the problem at hand.

# Below are some of the most popular platforms where you can explore and download data.
# 1) Kaggle provides an extensive range of datasets from various domains. It’s also a platform for data science
# competitions, helping users learn and practice real-world applications of machine learning.
# 2) UCI Machine Learning Repository is one of the oldest and most reputable collections of machine learning datasets.
# It features a variety of datasets commonly used in research and educational settings, covering structured, tabular data.
# 3) Google Dataset Search aggregates datasets from multiple public sources, including universities, government
# institutions, and research labs. It’s a useful tool for discovering datasets across a wide range of topics and formats.

# In machine learning, the processes of training, validation, and testing are crucial for developing and assessing models
# effectively. These concepts are explained below.
# 1) Training: This is the foundational step where the machine learning model is formed. During training, the
# model learns from a dataset consisting of input-output pairs. It performs calculations to adjust its internal
# parameters and minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outputs. Essentially, the model
# analyzes the data to identify patterns and relationships, allowing it to make informed predictions on new,
# unseen data.
# 2) Validation: This process occurs concurrently with training and involves evaluating the model on a separate
# validation dataset, which the model has not encountered during the training. This step is crucial for fine-tuning
# the model by adjusting hyperparameters and ensuring it does not overfit (where the model learns the training
# data too well but performs poorly on new data). The validation process helps confirm that the model can
# generalize its learning to new data.
# 3) Testing: Finally, the model is assessed using a testing dataset. This dataset is separate from both the
# training and validation datasets. The testing phase measures the model’s performance on completely new
# data, indicating how well it will perform in real-world scenarios. Please note that the validation subset should
# be used only in the validation phase, and not to test the ML model. Instead, we only use testing subset to test
# the performance of the ML model.

# Problem-solving in AI
# Understand the problem fully before jumping into coding.
# Clearly define the problem you want to solve.
# Identify inputs (features) and outputs.
# Choose the right model. Different data types require different models.
# Start with a simple approach and gradually add complexity. Often, a basic approach can provide good results,
# and complexity can be added as needed.
